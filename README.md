# jerry
stupid robot nuisance.
i built this to be that though, so...

presses keys and f*cks with your mouse. occasionally talks.

## little notice
i hold 0 responsibility over what this thing does. you are on your own if he does anything bad.

## other little notice
the invisible version hides the console window, so just kill his process in task manager if he gets out of hand.

he doesn't cloak himself, so his process name is `jerry.exe`.
